git clone https://github.com/REPS0LL/Mykhailova.University.VirtualPetAdoptionCenter.git

2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Build the project. In Visual Studio, you can do this by clicking `Build > Build Solution`.

## Running the Application

1. Set `VirtualPetAdoptionCenter.Web` as the startup project.
2. Run the application. In Visual Studio, you can do this by clicking `Run > Start Debugging`.

# Project Architecture

The project is structured into two main parts: the front-end and the back-end.

## Front-End

The front-end is built with Razor Pages, HTML, and CSS. The CSS files are located in the `VirtualPetAdoptionCenter.Web/wwwroot/css` directory. The main CSS file is `Site.css`, which contains the styles for the entire application.

## Back-End

The back-end is built with C#. It follows a service-oriented architecture, with services handling the business logic of the application. The services are located in the `VirtualPetAdoptionCenter.Core/Services` directory.

The `AccountService` is responsible for user registration and authentication. It uses an `IEncryption` service for password encryption and an `IEmailService` for sending registration emails.

The `PetService` is responsible for managing the pets in the application. It handles operations such as creating, updating, and deleting pets, as well as retrieving pet information.

The `Groomservice` is responsible for managing the grooming activities of pets in the Virtual Pet Adoption Center application.


## Database

The application uses a relational database managed by Entity Framework. The `VirtualPetAdoptionCenterDbContext` class is responsible for interacting with the database. The database schema is defined by the `UserModel` class.


### Future feature
Pet Trade: You can trade pets with other users. When you click on the button, you will have the opportunity to choose which pet you want to get, but at the same time you will need to offer your pet.
Pet Return: Allows you to return your pet. When you click the button, your pet will disappear from the list of your pets
