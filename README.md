# Project Architecture

The project is structured into two main parts: the front-end and the back-end.

## Front-End

The front-end is built with Razor Pages, HTML, and CSS. The CSS files are located in the `VirtualPetAdoptionCenter.Web/wwwroot/css` directory. The main CSS file is `Site.css`, which contains the styles for the entire application.

## Back-End

The back-end is built with C#. It follows a service-oriented architecture, with services handling the business logic of the application. The services are located in the `VirtualPetAdoptionCenter.Core/Services` directory.

The `AccountService` is responsible for user registration and authentication. It uses an `IEncryption` service for password encryption and an `IEmailService` for sending registration emails.

The `PetService` is responsible for managing the pets in the application. It handles operations such as creating, updating, and deleting pets, as well as retrieving pet information.

The `Groomservice` is responsible for managing the grooming activities of pets in the Virtual Pet Adoption Center application.


## Database

The application uses a relational database managed by Entity Framework. The `VirtualPetAdoptionCenterDbContext` class is responsible for interacting with the database. The database schema is defined by the `UserModel` class.
